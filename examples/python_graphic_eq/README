This demo displays a Graphic EQ that is dynamically updated based
on data published by the server on channel "chan1".

A producer process (producer.py) generates random data and uses
Hookbox's REST api to publish the data on the channel mentioned above.

A Quixote based web application (webapp.py) serves the main page and also
handles call backs from the Hookbox process.

jQuery and jQuery-ui are used on the web page to render the sliders
which make up our EQ widget.
